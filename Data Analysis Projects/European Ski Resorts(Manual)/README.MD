# A Data Driven Approach to European Ski Resorts

A manual & library free analysis of ski resort prices, features, and offerings.

Imagine the following: 
1. The companies internet is down( a common issue these days).
2. Someones fudged the local repo and pandas install.
3. A business critical meeting is coming up in 30 minutes.

In such a scenario a less informative, but still useful analysis could save the day.

Part 1 of a 2 Part Series. Part 2 will use pandas, numpy, and seaborn ot offer a full featured analysis
