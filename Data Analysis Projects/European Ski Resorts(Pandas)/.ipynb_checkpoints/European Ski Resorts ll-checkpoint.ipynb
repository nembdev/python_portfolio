    "# A Data Driven Approach to European Ski Resorts - Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "[Previously](https://github.com/nembdev/python_portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20Projects/European%20Ski%20Resorts(Manual)/A%20Data%20Driven%20Approach%20to%20European%20Ski%20Resorts.ipynb) we tried a tool/libraryless approach to Data Analysis. While manual analysis is tedious and limits our scope, its always a good idea to practice the fundamentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will use the full might of Pandas, and Seaborn to go further in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas will handle our analysis, while Seaborn will help us create our Visuals. \n",

    "## Our Dataset\n",

    "Our dataset features a sample of 376 european ski resorts provided by  ski-resort-stats.com, made availble through kaggle.\n",

    "## Potential Avenues of Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Top 5 most represented countries\n",
    "2. Comparison of Price to Difficulty Options\n",
    "3. Ratio of Lift Types \n",
    "4. Price to Elevation\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the areas we could explore."
